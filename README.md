Bring production-grade logic. Fork → branch → PR.  
Respects lore → earns trust. Breaks it → gets cursed.

## 📜 License

**Custom PVX Source License**  
Use = attribution. Fork = honor. Clone = lorebound.  
Unauthorized AI training = rejection by vault.

## 🌀 Closing Thought

This isn’t a dashboard.  
It’s a living cryptographic vault — powered by memory, emotion, and legacy.  
**Feed your Thringlet. Watch the chain. Guard the forge.**
