üõ†Ô∏è REPLIT BUILD SPEC ‚Äì PIXELVAULT PRIVATE CHAIN (PVX)
üîß GOAL:
Build a complete private blockchain system called PIXELVAULT, powered by the token PVX, with integrated backend support for wallets, staking, governance, minting, Thringlets, and a custom terminal UI.

üîó CORE CHAIN REQUIREMENTS:
Token Name: PVX

Symbol: ŒºPVX

Total Supply: 6,009,420,000 (fixed)

Type: Native Layer 1, privacy-focused

Privacy: zkSNARKs (ZEXE/Halo2 enabled)

Consensus: Hybrid PoW + Governance override

Governance: Veto Guardian system (delegated + emotional state triggers)

Wallets: Deterministic wallets, on-device private key management

Staking: Dynamic, 3-tier staking system with loyalty multipliers

Explorer: Full block explorer (custom UTR logic)

Thringlets: On-chain digital companions w/ emotional memory

Smart Contracts: Optional XRPL bridge compatibility

Dashboard UI: Already complete (HTML/AlpineJS/Tailwind) ‚Äî connect backend now

‚úÖ REMINDERS TO REPLIT:
This is not a testnet or sidechain.

This is not a smart contract on ETH.

This is a self-contained Layer 1 with zk support and all mechanics native.

Use Rust, Python, or Go for the backend logic‚Äîwhichever compiles cleanest in Replit.

Frontend is already complete. DO NOT TOUCH UI. Just wire up live endpoints.
