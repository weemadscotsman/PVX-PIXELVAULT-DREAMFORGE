=== REPLIT FIX CHECKLIST – PIXELVAULT PLATFORM ===

1. THRINGLET PERSONALITY ENDPOINT IS BROKEN
→ Fix: Implement /api/thringlet/personality properly in Express backend
→ Validate: Should return JSON of Thringlet traits when called

2. DEAD BUTTONS ON FRONTEND
→ Audit: Every button across WalletPage, MiningSection, StakingPage, GovernancePage
→ Link: Make sure they trigger actual API calls AND reflect backend state
→ Example: Click STAKE should POST to /api/stake/start with wallet auth

3. WALLET SESSION ISN’T PROPAGATING
→ Fix ConnectWalletButton.tsx:
   ✓ Must pass wallet address + passphrase securely to backend
   ✓ On success, store token or hash, not raw passphrase
→ Fix API handlers to expect and validate the wallet’s session/token

4. MINING PAGE IS DISCONNECTED
→ Bug: Wallet connected but mining controls are hidden or disabled
→ Fix: On wallet connect, MiningSection should show mine controls
→ Action: Button must POST to /api/blockchain/mining/start

5. STAKING LOGIC IS HALF-CONNECTED
→ Issue: Stake action sometimes posts to wrong controller
→ Fix: Replace `stakeController.fixed.ts` with main controller in routes
→ Ensure the /api/stake/start route actually processes wallet-linked stake

6. GAPS IN GOVERNANCE/VETO HOOKS
→ Fix: All use-veto-guardian hooks must tie to real wallet session
→ Verify: Veto action routes must resolve to the wallet's session context

7. CONNECT/DISCONNECT BUTTONS MISSING IN HEADER
→ Add ConnectWalletButton and Disconnect logic globally (Header.tsx)
→ Ensure Disconnect:
   ✓ Clears memory
   ✓ Clears localStorage
   ✓ Redirects to login page cleanly

8. MISSING LIVE UPDATES
→ WebSocket endpoint must send:
   ✓ mining event
   ✓ staking event
   ✓ veto/governance event
→ All dashboard panels should live-sync when data changes

9. BACKEND ROUTE SANITY CHECK
→ Check for:
   ✓ Route collisions
   ✓ Double mounts
   ✓ "fixed.ts" usage – REMOVE this in production
→ Example: stakeController.fixed.ts should be deleted or merged

10. DEBUGGING LOGIC POLISH
→ Remove console.log(JSON.stringify({error: e})) dumps
→ Add real error handlers with HTTP status and message response

MANDATE: EVERY CLICKABLE ACTION IN THE UI **MUST** RESULT IN A LIVE, TRACKABLE BACKEND RESPONSE.

NO DEAD INTERACTIONS. NO FAKE STATES. NO PLACEHOLDERS.
