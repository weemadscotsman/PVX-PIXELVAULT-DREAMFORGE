🚨 FINAL STATUS CHECK: PVX SYSTEM – (Real backend, full UI/UX routing, API integration, mining, staking, TX flow)

You've done a monstrous job gutting and wiring the frontend panels, realigning the CLI logic, adding WebSocket data pipes, fixing routing, and adding the new pages (NFTs, TX Visualizer, TrendRadar, etc.). Now let’s lock in the cleanup punch list based on everything from that ultra-long log.

🔧 MUST FIX – CORE BACKEND INTERACTIONS
✅ Real-Time TX Visualizer (Functional but Incomplete)
 WebSocket wired up and listening

 TX types parsed correctly

 Page + sidebar routing set

 🔴 Layout and design are still busted — needs proper spacing, color coding, timestamp badges, animated flow lines

🔥 Staking Rewards Claim (NOT FUNCTIONAL YET)
 UI panel added

 ClaimRewardDialog wired

 🔴 No reward TX is generated on the backend (POST /api/stake/claim must emit a transaction and write to chain)

 🔴 WebSocket must broadcast this stake-claim TX

💣 Universal TX Registry (UTR)
 🔴 HTML returned instead of JSON from /api/utr/logs — indicates route is not properly registered or error handling is broken

 🔴 Must respond with array of TXs (not HTML error pages)

⚙️ Mining Hardware Selection
 CPU / GPU / ASIC selector implemented

 Multiplier logic wired (ASIC = 100x etc.)

 🟡 Show realtime hashrate per hardware (for UX clarity)

 🟡 Sync mining rewards TX writeback to wallet + UTR

📦 Wallet QR Generation
 QRCode for wallet address is live via qrcode.react

 🟡 Add “Download QR” button for mobile use case

 🟡 Optional: Add modal popup when clicking QR with copy/share actions

🧱 ARCHITECTURAL PATCHES NEEDED
🔧 WebSocket Port Bug
 🔴 "wss://localhost:undefined" appears when VITE_WS_URL not set

 ✅ Fix: add fallback in src/constants/env.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
export const WS_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_WS_URL || `ws://${window.location.hostname}:5173`;
Then everywhere you use WebSocket, reference:

ts
Copy
Edit
const socket = new WebSocket(`${WS_URL}/?token=${userToken}`);
🔄 TrendRadar Real Data Visual
 Trend data wired from backend

 🔴 Graph looks fake/placeholder — rebuild using animated radial SVG or canvas-based radar

 🟡 Add hover/tap tooltips per metric (24h, 7d, 30d trends)

🧪 ROUTING & PANEL COMPLETION (Cross-check)
Component	Button / Feature	Status
Wallet	QR, Send/Receive, Tabs	✅ Working
Staking	Create, Claim, Dialog	🟥 Incomplete
Dashboard	View All blocks/txs/nfts	✅ Working
BlockchainPage	View All Blocks	✅ Working
NFTCollection	View All NFTs	✅ Working
GovernancePanel	View All Proposals	✅ Working
Quick Actions	View All Actions	✅ Working
TX Visualizer	Real-time flow + layout	🟥 Styling Weak
TrendRadar	Real metrics, nice graph	🟥 Needs visual
Drops Terminal	Claim button	🟥 404 or dead
UTR TX Log	Load TXs	🟥 JSON fail

✅ PRIORITY ORDER (Execution Queue)
🔥 Fix stake/claim endpoint → generate reward TX + WebSocket broadcast

⚙️ Fix UTR route to return JSON not HTML

🌐 Patch WebSocket fallback port in env.ts

🧠 Rebuild TrendRadar graph UI (radial or animated bar)

💅 Refine TransactionVisualizer layout (spacing, icons, timeline FX)

🧼 Fix Drop Terminal claim button to route correctly

🔐 Audit all TX-generating actions (mining, claiming, staking) → must all emit real on-chain TXs
