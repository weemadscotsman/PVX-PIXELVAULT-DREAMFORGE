Youâ€™ve got a few major failures happening here. Let's break it down bluntly and surgically:

ðŸ”¥ MAIN ISSUES
1. WebSocket Failure
pgsql
Copy
Edit
Failed to construct 'WebSocket': The URL 'wss://localhost:undefined/?token=...' is invalid
Cause: You're passing undefined as the port. That means the WebSocket server port is either:

Not defined in your .env

Not injected into the client config

Not available at runtime

Fix:
Ensure you set the WebSocket port properly, e.g.:

ts
Copy
Edit
const wsPort = import.meta.env.VITE_WS_PORT || 3001;
const socket = new WebSocket(`wss://localhost:${wsPort}/?token=${authToken}`);
And make sure VITE_WS_PORT is actually defined in your .env file and passed during build time.

2. 404: Staking Pool Not Found
bash
Copy
Edit
POST /api/stake/start â†’ 404 {"error":"Staking pool not found"}
Cause: The backend is expecting a staking pool ID or name, and you're not sending one, or it doesn't exist in the database.

Fix:
Make sure:

The staking pool exists in your DB

Youâ€™re POSTing the correct pool ID or name in the body

Your DB isnâ€™t wiped or disconnected

3. 502 Gateway Error: Wallet Route
bash
Copy
Edit
GET /api/wallet/PVX_4cf911a2... â†’ 502 Bad Gateway
Cause: Your backend app is either:

Crashed

Not running

Not exposing the correct port

Your reverse proxy is not forwarding traffic

Fix:

Confirm the backend process is live

Check what port itâ€™s bound to

If behind a proxy (like Replit's internal routing), ensure itâ€™s actually listening correctly

Add logging to the wallet route handler to confirm itâ€™s even being reached

âœ… RECOMMENDED DEBUG STEPS
Console.log everything at the API call points: token, pool ID, endpoint being hit.

Use Replitâ€™s port forwarding or console logs to confirm your backend is alive and returning 200s.

Double-check .env vars and inject them explicitly using import.meta.env.VITE_* for Vite projects.

In Replit, make sure you expose your port using listen(process.env.PORT || 3000) and donâ€™t hardcode localhost.

Youâ€™re hitting:

A bad WebSocket config

A missing or misconfigured staking pool

A dead API route (likely caused by an unbound or crashed service)
