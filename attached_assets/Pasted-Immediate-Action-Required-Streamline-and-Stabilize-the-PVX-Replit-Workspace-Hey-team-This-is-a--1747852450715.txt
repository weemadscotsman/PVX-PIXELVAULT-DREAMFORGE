Immediate Action Required â€“ Streamline and Stabilize the PVX Replit Workspace

Hey team,

This is a direct callout to address the chaotic dev loop and repeated instability plaguing the PIXELVAULT (PVX) build on Replit. We've hit a critical point: countless unnecessary restarts, broken matrix effects, wallet authentication inconsistencies, and half-integrated UI logic have compounded into a situation thatâ€™s hemorrhaging time and budget.

ðŸš¨ Core Issues:
Matrix Rain: Was implemented, lost, then repeatedly broken. It still lacks a stable, site-wide implementation with correct z-index layering, blending, and thematic kanji bleed-through.

PageLayout Standardization: Pushed live before full conversion. Broke multiple pages due to inconsistent tag closure and partial layout swaps (e.g., DashboardLayout remnants).

Wallet System:

New wallets are corrupt on creation.

Authentication fails due to mismatched hash logic or missing passphrase data in memory/db.

Connect/Disconnect buttons were added but lacked proper auth/session clearance and redirect logic until very late in dev flow.

Governance + Veto Logic: Routes for veto guardians were not implemented but frontend assumed them, causing 404s. Fixed too late in the flow.

WebSocket Configuration: Botched. Was defaulting to wss://localhost:undefined/ and failing silently or throwing noisy console errors.

UI/UX: Completely collapsed due to layout fragmenting. "One menu, one panel, one connection per section" was violated.

ðŸ”§ What You Need To Do Immediately:
1. Stop Deploying Broken Layout Updates
Do not push any layout changes without verifying all pages render properly. Use visual diffs or automated snapshot checks.

2. Matrix Rain = FIX ONCE, GLOBALLY
Implement a single, scoped, CSS-Canvas hybrid matrix effect with proper bleed-through layering. It should:

Stay in the background, never block content

Support z-index and opacity tuning

Use authentic Matrix kanji (not generic letters)

Work on every page, including the footer

3. Wallet Auth = LOCK DOWN
Rebuild wallet creation and login logic to:

Always hash/passphrase consistently

Save credentials in both DB and memory on creation

Validate consistently on login

Clean logout = clears local/session storage + redirects to /auth

4. WebSocket = CONFIGURE PROPERLY
Set wss:// host dynamically using .env or default to production-safe fallback. Donâ€™t leave ports or tokens undefined.

5. Veto + Governance = FINISH IT
No more placeholder routes. Every frontend button needs a matching backend endpoint. All veto actions must be tracked, auditable, and handled with correct return states.

6. Replit Workflow = STABILIZE
Donâ€™t burn through another $100 chasing the same bugs. Stop the restart-spam. Introduce pre-push checks, commit guards, and bundle verifications.

ðŸ§© Closing Shot:
Weâ€™re not in MVP phase. Weâ€™re in legacy-critical infrastructure mode here. This isnâ€™t a toy projectâ€”itâ€™s a full privacy-chain system powering community governance, identity, and transaction logic. Every broken redirect, every failed login, every lost visual effect is breaking user trust.

Replit: tighten up. Stop half-finishing things, and verify before you ship.

Fix it. All of it. Clean. Now.
