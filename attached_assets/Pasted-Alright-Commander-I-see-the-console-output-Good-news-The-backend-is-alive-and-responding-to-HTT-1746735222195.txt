Alright, Commander! I see the console output.
Good news: The backend is alive and responding to HTTP requests for wallet data, transaction history, and blockchain trends (the radar!). That's solid progress!
Bad news: We have a â€“ a frontend error. The stack trace points to a failed WebSocket connection attempt with an DOMExceptioninvalid URL: .wss://localhost:undefined/...
This means the frontend code that's trying to connect to the WebSocket server is failing to get the correct port number, resulting in in the URL.undefined
This is likely happening in the component where we added the WebSocket connection logic, or potentially in a shared WebSocket hook if one was created.TransactionFlowVisualizer.tsx
Plan: Fix the WebSocket URL Construction
We need to ensure the WebSocket URL uses the correct protocol, hostname, and port from the browser's current location.
Step 1: Locate the WebSocket Connection Code
Find the file where is called in your frontend code. Based on our previous steps, this is most likely new WebSocket(...)client/src/components/visualization/TransactionFlowVisualizer.tsx.
Step 2: Modify the WebSocket URL Construction
We need to replace the hardcoded or incorrect URL construction with one that dynamically gets the browser's current location details.
Action: Edit client/src/components/visualization/TransactionFlowVisualizer.tsx
Find the hook where the call is made. Modify the useEffectnew WebSocket(wsUrl)wsUrl variable.
Replace this line (or similar):
const wsUrl = `ws://localhost:5000/ws`; // Example WebSocket URL (adjust port/protocol)
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
With this code that builds the URL dynamically:
// Dynamically determine WebSocket URL based on current location
        const protocol = window.location.protocol === 'https:' ? 'wss:' : 'ws:';
        // Use window.location.hostname for the host
        // Use window.location.port if it exists, otherwise default (e.g., 80 for http, 443 for https, or your backend's default)
        // Replit preview URLs often don't have a port in window.location.port, so we might need a fallback or check if it's empty.
        // Let's try using the backend's known port if window.location.port is empty.
        const port = window.location.port || (window.location.protocol === 'https:' ? '443' : '80'); // Fallback to standard ports
        // If your backend is consistently on port 5000 in Replit, you might hardcode 5000 here if window.location.port is unreliable.
        // Let's try using the hostname and a known backend port (5000 seems common in Replit logs) if window.location.port is empty.
        // A more robust approach for Replit might be to get the backend URL from an environment variable exposed to the frontend.
        // For now, let's try combining hostname and a likely port, falling back to standard ports if needed.

        let wsUrl = `${protocol}//${window.location.hostname}`;
        // Only add port if it's not the default for the protocol
        if (port && ((protocol === 'ws:' && port !== '80') || (protocol === 'wss:' && port !== '443'))) {
             wsUrl += `:${port}`;
        }
        wsUrl += `/ws`; // Add the WebSocket path

        console.log(`Attempting WebSocket connection to: ${wsUrl}`); // Log the URL being attempted

        const websocket = new WebSocket(wsUrl);

        // ... (rest of the websocket event handlers: onopen, onmessage, onerror, onclose) ...
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Explanation:
window.location.protocol: Gets or and converts to or .http:https:ws:wss:
window.location.hostname: Gets the domain name (e.g., ).45c78ef3-... replit.dev
window.location.port: Gets the port number . In some Replit preview URLs, this might be empty.if it's explicitly in the URL
The logic attempts to use first, falling back to standard HTTP/HTTPS ports (80/443). If your backend is consistently on a specific non-standard port in Replit (like 5000), and window.location.portwindow.location.port is empty, you might need a more specific fallback like . Let's try the version above first as it's more standard.const port = window.location.port || '5000';
Step 3: Restart and Verify
Go to Replit Shell.
Run (or ).npm startnpm run dev
Open Replit web preview.
Navigate to the page (or wherever the UTR ExplorerTransactionFlowVisualizer component is used).
Expected Outcome:
The related to the invalid WebSocket URL should disappear from the console. You should see the DOMExceptionAttempting WebSocket connection to: [a valid URL] log. The WebSocket should ideally connect ( log), and if your backend is broadcasting data, the WebSocket connectedonmessage handler should start logging received messages.
This fixes the immediate crash caused by the invalid URL and establishes the real-time communication channel for the visualizer and other potential real-time features.
Let me know if this resolves the WebSocket connection error! We're smoothing out the real-time data flow!
