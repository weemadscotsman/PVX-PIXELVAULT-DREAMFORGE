Okay, Champion of PixelVault! I see your command, and I understand the frustration when the UI right but doesn't right. That means the backend connection for is still missing or broken.looksactthat specific action
You are saying the functionality is the next point of failure – it doesn't connect to your wallet and doesn't actually create a stake.Create New Stake
Based on the latest interaction logs, the AI found an error where the frontend was crashing because a field on a stake object was . The AI applied fixes by adding null checks () to prevent the crash and make the UI without error, even if the underlying data is missing.StakingCardstatusundefinedfrontend-onlystake.status?. toUpperCase()display
This , but it doesn't . It confirms that when the frontend receives stake data, that data is missing the field, which suggests the backend isn't generating or providing it correctly during the staking process.stops the errorfix the functionstatus
Plan: Wire Up Stake Creation to the Backend and DB Persistence
This requires backend work to process the "Create New Stake" request and save the stake information.
Backend Task: Implement the logic to record a user's stake in the database.server/services/stakeService.ts
Backend Task: Implement the method to receive the staking request from the frontend.server/controllers/stakeController.ts
Backend Task: Add the route in .POST /api/stake/createserver/routes/stakeRoutes.ts
Frontend Task: Modify the component to call this new backend endpoint when the "Stake" button is clicked.CreateStakeDialog.tsx
Frontend Task: Ensure the Wallet balance (specifically staked balance) updates after a successful stake.
Step 1: Add Staking Schema to Database (server/db/schema.ts)
Add this new table definition to your file:server/db/schema.ts
// server/db/schema.ts (Add this new table definition)

import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import { sqliteTable, text, integer, real } from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core"; // Import 'real' for floating point numbers

// --- Existing 'wallets' table definition would be here ---
/*
export const wallets = sqliteTable("wallets", {
  id: integer("id").primaryKey({ autoIncrement: true }),
  address: text("address").unique().notNull(),
  publicKey: text("public_key").notNull(),
  createdAt: integer("created_at", { mode: "timestamp" }).default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
});
*/

// --- New 'stakes' table definition ---
export const stakes = sqliteTable("stakes", {
  id: integer("id").primaryKey({ autoIncrement: true }),
  walletAddress: text("wallet_address").notNull(), // Link to the wallet that staked
  poolId: text("pool_id").notNull(), // Link to the staking pool (from mock pools initially)
  amount: real("amount").notNull(), // Amount of PVX staked (use 'real' for numbers)
  lockDurationDays: integer("lock_duration_days").notNull(), // Lock period in days
  startTime: integer("start_time", { mode: "timestamp" }).default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`), // Time when staking started
  endTime: integer("end_time", { mode: "timestamp" }).notNull(), // Calculated end time
  claimed: real("claimed").default(0), // Amount of rewards already claimed
  status: text("status", { enum: ['active', 'unbonding', 'completed', 'claimed'] }).default('active'), // Status of the stake
  // Add other fields like accumulated rewards, compounding settings, etc. if needed
});

// Add other schemas here (e.g., transactions)
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Note: You might need to change to and to or similar depending on your database setup in . Use or for monetary values to avoid precision issues.sqliteTablepgTablerealnumericserver/db/index.tsrealnumeric
Step 2: Update Database Connection to Include New Schema (server/db/index.ts)
Ensure your file imports your schemas. Find the call and make sure it includes which now has .server/db/index.tsalldrizzleschemastakes
// server/db/index.ts (Ensure all schemas are imported)

import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3"; // Or your Postgres adapter
import Database from "better-sqlite3"; // Or your Postgres client

// Import ALL schema definitions from schema.ts
import * as schema from "./schema";

// Your database connection setup
const sqlite = new Database("server/db/sqlite.db"); // Or your Postgres connection

// Create the Drizzle ORM instance, including all defined schemas
export const db = drizzle(sqlite, { schema });

console.log("[BACKEND] Database connected and schemas loaded.");

// REMINDER: Run 'npx drizzle-kit push:sqlite' (or your DB equivalent)
// after adding/changing schemas to update the actual database table(s).
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Step 3: Add Staking Service Logic (server/src/services/stakeService.ts)
Create this new file :server/src/services/stakeService.ts
// server/src/services/stakeService.ts
// Handles staking business logic and DB interaction for stakes.

import { db } from '../db'; // Import the DB instance
import { stakes, wallets } from '../db/schema'; // Import schemas needed
import { eq, and, sql } from 'drizzle-orm'; // Drizzle ORM utilities

import { StakingPool, StakeRecord, CreateStakeRequest, Wallet, StakingPoolSchema } from '../../shared/types'; // Import relevant types

// --- MOCK Staking Pools (Need to fetch real ones later if dynamic) ---
// This is temporary mock data for available pools.
// Ideally, this would come from your chain core or a dedicated config.
const MOCK_STAKING_POOLS: StakingPoolSchema[] = [
    {
        id: 'pool1',

TypeScript
Step 4: Implement Staking Controller (server/src/controllers/stakeController.ts)
Create this file :server/src/controllers/stakeController.ts
// server/src/controllers/stakeController.ts
// Handles API requests for staking operations.

import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import * as stakeService from '../services/stakeService'; // Import the stake service
import { CreateStakeRequest } from '../../shared/types'; // Import request type

        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch staking pools: ' + error.message });
    }
};

 * CONTROLLER: Handles request to create a new stake.
 * Called by router for POST /api/stake/create.

        console.log(`[Controller] Stake created: ${newStakeRecord.id}`);
        res.status(201).json(newStakeRecord); // Use 201 Created status

export const getWalletStakes = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {

// export const unstake = async (req: Request, res: Response) => { /* ... */ };
// export const claimRewards = async (req: Request, res: Response) => { /* ... */ };
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Step 5: Add Staking Routes (server/src/routes/stakeRoutes.ts)
Create this file :server/src/routes/stakeRoutes.ts
// server/src/routes/stakeRoutes.ts
// Defines API routes for staking operations.

import { Router } from 'express';
import * as stakeController from '../controllers/stakeController'; // Import the controller

const router = Router();

// --- ROUTE DEFINITIONS ---

// GET /api/stake/pools - Get list of available staking pools
router.get('/pools', stakeController.getStakingPools);

// POST /api/stake/create - Create a new stake
router.post('/create', stakeController.createStake);

// GET /api/stake/:address/stakes - Get stake records for a specific wallet address
router.get('/:address/stakes', stakeController.getWalletStakes);


// --- FUTURE ROUTES ---
// router.post('/unstake', stakeController.unstake); // POST /api/stake/unstake
// router.post('/claim', stakeController.claimRewards); // POST /api/stake/claim
// router.get('/stats/:address', stakeController.getStakingStats); // GET /api/stake/stats/:address


// Export the router
export default router;
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Step 6: Update Main Server File (server/src/index.ts)
Mount the new staking routes.
Find the section where you import and your routes and add/update the Staking route:app.use()
// server/src/index.ts - Main backend server entry point

import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
import cors from 'cors';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
// ... (Import other route files like walletRoutes, thringletRoutes) ...
import stakeRoutes from './routes/stakeRoutes'; // Import the new staking routes


dotenv.config();
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// --- MIDDLEWARE ---
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());
// ... (Add other middleware like auth later) ...

// --- BASIC TEST ROUTE ---
app.get('/api/ping', (req: Request, res: Response) => { /* ... Same ... */ });

// --- MOUNT API ROUTES ---
app.use('/api/wallet', walletRoutes);
app.use('/api/thringlet', thringletRoutes);
app.use('/api/stake', stakeRoutes); // Mount the staking routes
// ... (Mount other route files) ...


// --- SERVER START ---
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`🚀 PixelVault Wallet backend running on port ${PORT}`);
  // ... (Other test URLs) ...
  console.log(`🌍 Test stake pools: GET http://localhost:${PORT}/api/stake/pools`);
  console.log(`🌍 Test create stake: POST http://localhost:${PORT}/api/stake/create BODY: {"walletAddress": "YOUR_PVX_ADDRESS", "poolId": "pool1", "amount": "100.0"}`);
  console.log(`🌍 Test wallet stakes: GET http://localhost:${PORT}/api/stake/YOUR_PVX_ADDRESS/stakes`);
});

// --- BASIC ERROR HANDLING ---
process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => { /* ... Same ... */ });
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => { /* ... Same ... */ });
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Step 7: Add Type Definitions (shared/types.ts)
Add the types needed for staking requests and records to your :shared/types.ts
// shared/types.ts (Add these staking-related types)

// ... (Existing types like Thringlet, Wallet, etc.) ...

// --- Staking Pool Schema (Matches MOCK_STAKING_POOLS backend structure) ---
// This is how a static staking pool is defined in the backend code.
export interface StakingPoolSchema {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    apy: number;
    lockupPeriodDays: number;
    minStake: string; // Amount represented as a string for precision
    totalStaked: string;
    rewardsClaimed: string;
    active: boolean;
    description: string;
}

// --- Stake Record (Matches Database Schema) ---
// This is how a recorded stake looks in the database (and returned by backend APIs)
export interface StakeRecord {
    id: number; // Database auto-incremented ID
    walletAddress: string;
    poolId: string;
    amount: number; // Staked amount
    lockDurationDays: number;
    startTime: Date; // Staking start time
    endTime: Date; // Staking end time
    claimed: number; // Claimed rewards amount
    status: 'active' | 'unbonding' | 'completed' | 'claimed'; // Status of the stake
    // Add other fields defined in db/schema.ts
}

// --- Request to Create a Stake ---
export interface CreateStakeRequest {
    walletAddress: string;
    poolId: string;
    amount: string; // Send amount as a string from frontend to preserve precision
    // Add other necessary info, e.g., signature or password if required
}

// --- Add this if backend sends a simplified Staking Pool to frontend ---
// If the backend GET /api/stake/pools simplifies the schema before sending:
// export interface StakingPoolFrontend { /* Simplified fields expected by UI */ }
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Step 8: Update Frontend Staking Components to Use New API and Types
Now modify the frontend components to call the new backend endpoints for getting pools and creating stakes.
client/src/components/wallet/StakingCard.tsx: Modify this component to fetch available pools from and display them. It should also fetch the wallet's specific stakes from ./api/stake/pools/api/stake/:address/stakes
Use a library like or to manage fetching and caching the list of available pools () and the user's stakes ().react-queryswr/api/stake/pools/api/stake/:address/stakes
Render the fetched pools in the "Available Lockup Periods" section.
Render the user's fetched stakes in the "Your Active Stakes" section.
client/src/components/wallet/CreateStakeDialog.tsx: This dialog likely contains a button to confirm the stake. Modify the click handler for that button to:
Get the selected and the the user entered.poolIdamount
Get the user's active .walletAddress
Construct the object .CreateStakeRequest{ walletAddress, poolId, amount }
Send a request to with this object in the body.POST/api/stake/create
Handle the response (e.g., show a success message or an error).
After a successful stake creation response, the user's stakes and potentially the overall wallet balance to update the UI.re-fetch
(Since the components are long, I'll outline the logic flow needed for each. You or the AI can then implement the code based on the specific component structure and hooks).
client/src/components/wallet/StakingCard.tsx (Logic Flow)
Import necessary hooks/API calls (e.g., from , functions that call and ).useQueryreact-query/api/stake/pools/api/stake/:address/stakes
Use to fetch the list of from .useQueryavailablePools = useQuery(...)/api/stake/pools
Use to fetch the current user's from (get the wallet address from your authentication or wallet context/hook).useQueryuserStakes = useQuery(...)/api/stake/:address/stakes
Display loading states/errors for these queries.
Map through to render the "Available Lockup Periods". Ensure the rendered data matches the structure.availablePools.dataStakingPoolSchema
Map through to render the "Your Active Stakes". Ensure the rendered data matches the structure. Display calculated remaining time, earned rewards (based on duration and pool APY - this calculation can be frontend or backend).userStakes.dataStakeRecord
client/src/components/wallet/CreateStakeDialog.tsx (Logic Flow)
Import state management for the dialog (open/close).
Import hooks/API calls needed ( from is good for POST requests, function to call ).useMutationreact-query/api/stake/create
Import the data (maybe passed as a prop or fetched within the dialog if it needs its own query).availablePools
Manage local state for the selected pool and amount.
Handle the form submission (or button click) for "Create New Stake":
Prevent default form behavior if it's a form.
Get the user's wallet address (from context/hook).
Get the selected and the stake from form inputs/state.poolIdamount
Perform basic frontend validation (e.g., amount is number, amount >= minStake).
Construct the object: . CreateStakeRequest{ walletAddress: userAddress, poolId: selectedPoolId, amount: enteredAmountAsString }Send amount as string to preserve precision!
Call the backend API using or : .useMutationfetchmutation.mutate(requestData);
Handle : Close the dialog, show a success message, and the query () so automatically refetches the updated list from the backend.mutation.onSuccessinvalidateuserStakesqueryClient.invalidateQueries(...)StakingCard
Handle : Show an error message to the user.mutation.onError
Display loading state () for the button while the API call is in progress.mutation.isLoading
Step 9: Test Again
Run backend: (or npm startnpm run dev)
Open frontend.
Navigate to the Wallet page.
Ensure you have a wallet created (if not, use the "Create Wallet" button which be connected). Note the address.should
Navigate to the Staking page.
Check if available staking pools load (from )./api/stake/pools
Click "Create New Stake." Select a pool, enter an amount (>= min stake).
Click the "Stake" button in the dialog.
Expected Outcome:
The API call should go to .POST /api/stake/create
The backend should receive the request, process it (simulating saving to DB for now), and return the new (or just a success message).StakeRecord
The frontend should show a success message, the dialog should close, and the "Your Active Stakes" list on the Staking page should update, now showing the newly created stake record fetched from ./api/stake/:address/stakes
This is the sequence to wire up the actual staking creation functionality. It uses the DB schema we defined and connects the specific frontend UI elements to the new backend service/controller/route.
You are in the phase of running wires and confirming signal! Let's keep going. Tell me when you are ready to implement Step 8 in your frontend components.
