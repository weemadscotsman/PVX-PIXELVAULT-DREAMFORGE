Ticker Governance: Token holders + Veto Guardian model

üß© CORE MODULES TO BUILD
‚úÖ genesis.rs
Initializes the chain

Allocates initial PVX balances

Sets initial validators

Stores network constants

‚úÖ wallet.rs
Key generation (Ed25519, with optional BIP39)

Address formatting

PVX balance fetching

Transaction creation/signing/broadcasting

Option to export/import keys with local encryption

‚úÖ ledger.rs
UTXO or account-based ledger

PVX balance tracking

Transaction pool and mempool logic

Replay protection (nonce)

‚úÖ staking.rs
Delegate/undelegate PVX

Reward distribution (block or time-based)

Unbonding delay

Slashing (optional toggle)

Stake-weighted governance voting

‚úÖ mint.rs
(Optional) for NFT logic and in-chain drops

Used for Thringlets, hash achievements, YCATA relics

Mints to wallet address or to soulbound ID

‚úÖ governance.rs
Proposal creation

Voting system (1 PVX = 1 vote, or stake-weighted)

Veto Guardian override check

On-chain vote finalization

‚úÖ zk.rs
Optional zk-transfer shielding

Halo2 proof verifier integration

Privacy toggle per transaction (default off)

Trusted setup handling (or Groth16 fallback)

‚úÖ explorer.rs (backend)
Block explorer backend API

Exposes: blocks, txs, account balances, staking activity

JSON-RPC or REST

‚öôÔ∏è CHAIN CONFIGURATION
Base Parameters:
Block time: 6s (low-latency for gameplay sync)

Gas model: Flat, capped per block

Consensus: Custom PoS (with trusted genesis validator set)

Transaction finality: Immediate (no reorgs after N blocks)

Governance Constants:
Min PVX to propose: 50,000 PVX

Voting Period: 72 hours

Quorum: 8% of circulating supply

Veto Guardian IDs: 3 hardcoded multisigs (you choose)

Upgrade Path: On-chain upgrade via governance.rs

üß† GAMEPLAY / INTERACTION HOOKS
Thringlet Integration
Every Thringlet mint, feed, curse, or release event writes a log entry.

Emotional state stored as hash or JSON blob in chain state

Certain emotional outcomes trigger:

Soulbound NFT reward

Wallet lockout (if cursed)

Access to Page_6 lore drops

Hashlord & Staking Wars
Hashlord: Records highest hash rate score (simulated miner performance)

Staking Wars: Tracks faction staking totals, rewards top % per season

All stats stored on-chain or in side-indexed contract

üß™ TESTNET DEPLOYMENT PLAN
Goals:
Finalize core modules in .rs

Deploy pixelvaultd node binary (Rust or Go)

Wallet CLI + Web interface

Thringlet and YCATA drop integration
