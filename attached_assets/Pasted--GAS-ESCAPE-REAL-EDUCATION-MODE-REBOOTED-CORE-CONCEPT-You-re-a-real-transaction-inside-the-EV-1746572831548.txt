🧬 GAS ESCAPE: REAL EDUCATION MODE
🔥 REBOOTED CORE CONCEPT:
You’re a real transaction inside the EVM network.
Your goal? Escape the mempool with the lowest gas and fastest confirmation —
WITHOUT getting frontrun, sandwiched, dropped, or overpaying like a rookie.

🧠 WHAT THIS GAME ACTUALLY TEACHES:
Concept	Game Mechanic
Mempool theory	You’re placed in a live mempool simulation with competing txs
Priority fee math	You set your maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFee
Base fee predictions	Gas increases/decreases each block depending on simulated network activity
Tx simulation logic	Preview if your tx will land or get bumped — with realtime feedback
Block construction	Validator simulation includes greed, fairness, and MEV exposure
Slippage + overpayment	If you set max fee way too high, the validator eats it — you lose points
Latency + propagation	Transaction broadcast delay affects success rate
Wallet optimization	Advanced players can configure batching, cancel-replace tx, etc.

🎮 GAME STRUCTURE
📦 LEVEL 1: Mempool Basics
10 txs per mempool cycle

Choose your fee

Learn rejection vs inclusion rules

🔓 LEVEL 2: Surge Mode
NFT mint hits the chain

Gas surges

Can you predict the baseFee increase?

🔐 LEVEL 3: Priority Wars
Compete against 5 AI bots with different fee strategies

Learn which gets in the block and why

🧠 LEVEL 4: Frontrun Simulation (MEV)
You broadcast a tx

MEV bots try to sandwich it

Learn how to avoid getting bled

🧮 WHAT WE TRACK:
Metric	Purpose
Base Fee per block	Simulated EIP-1559 burn rate
Inclusion cost	Final gas paid vs estimate
Latency penalty	If your tx lags → risk of failure
Overpayment	Bonus to validator = penalty to you
Survival Score	% of txs successfully mined vs attempted

👨‍🏫 BUILT-IN EDUCATION MODES
Gas Oracle Terminal: Learn how oracles predict next block’s base fee

TX Fee Estimator: Shows breakdown of what each field does

Flash Attack Logs: Replay the moment you got frontrun — what went wrong, how to stop it

Real Wallet Mode: Simulate txs using your actual wallet balances (but no real sending)

💣 HARDCORE MODE: CHAIN SURGE CHAOS
Gas hits 900+ gwei

Bots submit multiple TXs per block

You must:

Set base + priority fee manually

Predict validator greed

Escape while other users fail

💻 BONUS FOR LAUNCH:
Code is modular so every mechanic can be broken into:

React page (for visuals)

Terminal mode (CLI input / educational readout)

Wallet connect (optional)

Every level has a downloadable "gas strategy report" — real tx data, formulas, and learnings for every playthrough
