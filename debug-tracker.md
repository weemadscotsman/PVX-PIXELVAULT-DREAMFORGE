# PVX Blockchain Project Debug Tracker

## Current Issue
- Server starting but getting stuck in a loop: "Blockchain initialized and running"
- Client-side still getting 502 response from API endpoints

## Fixed Issues
1. ✅ Fixed TransactionType references in controller files
2. ✅ Corrected PostgreSQL client import issues in server/database/index.ts
3. ✅ Added missing checkDatabaseConnection and closeDatabase functions
4. ✅ Created dbInit export object in server/database/dbInit.ts
5. ✅ Fixed schema.ts bigint column issue (added `mode: 'number'` to all bigint columns)

## Fix In Progress
- Investigate infinite loop in blockchain initialization

## Next Steps
1. Check blockchain initialization code for infinite loops
2. Check server's port binding configuration
3. Verify express routes are properly setup

## Roadmap Issues to Investigate
- PostgreSQL connection issues
- WebSocket connection failures
- Route handler errors
- Type consistency across codebase
- Server not exposing API endpoints properly
